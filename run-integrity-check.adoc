Integrity checks 

Create a sandbox from a source database when the source database is busy. This could cause data corruption when the sandbox is cloned because the snapshot.

Check the integrity of all the objects in the sandbox are intact. 

. Sandbox tab. 
. Click the three dots menu of the sandbox clone to check integrity for. 
. Select *Run integrity check*. 
. In the Integrity check dialog, click *Integrity check*. 
. Check the status of the sandbox clone in Sandboxes or in Job monitoring. 

If the check fails, we recommend that you do not use this sandbox clone and create a new sandbox clone.
