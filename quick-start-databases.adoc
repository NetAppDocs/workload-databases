With Databases, you can get started immediately in Basic mode. If you'd like to use Workload Factory to discover hosts, manage resources, and more, you can get started in a few steps. 

You must have an AWS account to get started. 

== Quick start 
Follow these steps to get started with Workload Factory Databases.
