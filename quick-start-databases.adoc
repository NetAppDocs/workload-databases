[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you operate in _read-only_ or _read/write_ mode, you'll need to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[add credentials to an account manually^] which includes selecting workload capabilities, such as Databases and GenAI, and create the IAM policies to ensure you have the correct permissions for operating in _read-only_ or _read/write_ mode.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

With added credentials and IAM policies, you can either discover existing database resources in the inventory or link:create-database-server.html[deploy a host server]. The inventory provides a single pane of glass to manage all database resources.

[role="quick-margin-para"]

When you have Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) or FSx for Windows File Server hosts in your Databases inventory, you can link:explore-savings.html[explore savings with the savings calculator]. 

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The savings calculator compares various cost components of running Microsoft SQL Server workloads like storage, compute, SQL license, snapshots, and clones for your database workloads on FSx for ONTAP file systems against EBS, FSx for Windows File Server, and on-premises storage, and provides savings opportunities.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Workload Factory for Databases regularly analyzes Microsoft SQL Server deployments on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP storage from the Well-architected dashboard. The dashboard displays configuration issues and provides actionable recommendations to optimize performance, cost efficiency, and compliance with best practices.
