With Databases, you can get started immediately in _basic_ mode. If you'd like to use Workload Factory to discover hosts, manage resources, and more, you can get started in a few steps. 

You must have an AWS account to get started. 

Follow these steps to get started with Workload Factory Databases.

If you operate in _read_ or _automate_ mode, you'll need to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[add credentials to an account manually^] which includes selecting workload capabilities, such as Databases and AI, and creating the IAM policies to ensure you have the correct permissions for operating in _read_ or _automate_ mode.
