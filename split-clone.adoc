Splitting a sandbox clone from its source database creates a new database which will consume a certain amount of storage capacity. The clone gets deleted when the split is complete and the new database appears in the Inventory. 

.Before you begin
Consider how much storage capacity is needed for the new database. If needed, link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-fsx-ontap/increase-file-system-capacity.html[increase file system capacity^] for the FSx for ONTAP file system before you begin.  

.Steps

. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases Inventory*. 
. In Databases, select the *Sandboxes* tab.
. In the Sandboxes tab, click the three dots menu of the sandbox clone you want to split.
. Select *Split*. 
. In the Split dialog, click *Split*.
