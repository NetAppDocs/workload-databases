= Create a Microsoft SQL database in NetApp Workload Factory for Databases
:icons: font

[.lead]
Creating a new Microsoft SQL database enables you to manage the resource within NetApp Workload Factory for Databases.  

.About this task
Upon database creation, two new volumes are created in the FSx for ONTAP file system consisting of independent LUNs to host data and log files for the database. The database files in the new database are thin-provisioned and consume only a few MBs of the total size allocated for the new database. 

If you want to segregate storage for the database, you can do this by using a _virtual mount point_. The virtual mount point lets you consolidate databases to a few common drives on the host. 

Creating a database in workload factory requires _view, planning, and analysis_ permissions. Alternatively, you can copy or download a partially completed code template to complete the operation outside workload factory. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/permissions-reference.html[Learn about Workload Factory permissions^] to decide which mode you'd like to use. 

NOTE: Microsoft SQL Servers using SMB protocol don't support database creation. 

.Before you begin
Ensure you complete the following prerequisites before you create a new database. 

* *Credentials and permissions*: You must have link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[AWS account credentials and _view, planning, and analysis_ permissions^] to create a new database in Workload Factory. 
+
Alternatively, you can use the Codebox to copy a template so that you can deploy a database outside of workload factory using REST API. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/codebox-automation.html[Learn more about Codebox automation^].

* *Windows host*: You must have enough drive letters available on the Microsoft SQL Server to create new drives for the new database if you use _Quick create_ mode.

* *Microsoft SQL Server*: You must have a managed Microsoft SQL Server in workload factory for Databases to host the new database.

* *AWS Systems Manager*: Ensure the `NT Authority\SYSTEM` user privilege is enabled in the Microsoft SQL host via AWS Systems Manager.

== Create a database
You can use _Quick create_ or _Advanced create_ deployment modes to complete this task in Workload Factory.

. From the Databases menu, select *Inventory*. 
. In the Inventory, select *Microsoft SQL Server* as the database engine type. 
. Select a database server with a managed SQL server instance to create the database in.
. Click the action menu of the managed instance and then select *Create user database*.
. On the Create user database page, under Database information, provide the following: 
.. *Database name*: Enter name for the database. 
.. *Collation*: Select a collation for the database. The default collation SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS" on Microsoft SQL Server is selected. 
. Under File settings, provide the following: 
.. *File settings mode*: Select *Quick create*. 
.. *File names & path*:
+
* *Data file name*: Enter the data file name.
* *Log file name*: Enter the log file name. 
.. *File sizes*: Enter the data size and log size for the database. 
. Click *Create*.
