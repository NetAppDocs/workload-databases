[.lead]
Create a Microsoft SQL database in Workload Factory Databases with automate permissions. 

== About this task
Creating a new Microsoft SQL database within Workload Factory Databases means you can manage the resource within Workload Factory. 

If easy create is selected or new drive option is selected from Advanced create, two new volumes are created consisting of independent LUNs to host data and log files for the database.

Upon creation, the database files in the new database are thin-provisioned and consume only a few MBs of the total size allocated for the new database. 

You can create a database in Workload Factory or copy or download a code template to complete the operation outside Workload Factory. Review the Workload Factory operational modes to decide which mode you'd like to use. 

NOTE: Microsoft SQL servers using SMB protocol don't support database creation. 

=== Workload Factory operational modes
Workload Factory offers three operational modes depending on how comfortable you are with letting Workload Factory manage your AWS resources. 

*_Basic_ mode*: in this mode of operation, you don't need to associate any AWS account credentials in Workload Factory. You can copy or download an empty template from the Codebox to be completed outside Workload Factory. 

*_Read_ mode*: in this mode of operation, you provide AWS account credentials with read permissions which lets you complete the _Quick create_ or _Advanced create_ form and then copy or download it. 

*_Automate_ mode*: in this mode of operation, you provide AWS account credentials with automate permissions which lets you create and manage AWS resources within Workload Factory. 

In _Basic_ mode, you'll copy or download the empty template from the Codebox. In _Read_ mode, you can complete the _Quick create_ or _Advanced create_ form and then copy or download it. Depending on your level of trust, you can create the new server within Workload Factory with _automate_ permissions, download a completed YAML template with _read_ permissions, or download an empty YAML template in _basic_ mode. 

== Before you begin
Ensure you have the following prerequisites before you create a new database host. 

Credentials and permissions::: You must have link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/manage-credentials.html[AWS account credentials and automate mode permissions^] to create a new database host in Workload Factory. 
+
Alternatively, you can use the Codebox to copy an empty template or create a completed template so that you can deploy a database outside of Workload Factory using REST API, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/codebox-automation.html[Learn more about Codebox automation^].

Windows host::: You must have enough drive letters available on the Microsoft SQL server to create new drives for the new database. 

Microsoft SQL server::: You must have a managed Microsoft SQL server in Workload Factory Databases to host the new database.

Actions: If easy create is selected or new drive option is selected from Advanced create, two new volumes are created consisting of independent LUNs to host data and log files for the database.
+ 
Conditions: By default, the default collation on SQL server is selected. User can change this in the create database wizard.

.Steps
You can use _Quick create_ or _Advanced create_ deployment modes to complete this task in Workload Factory with _Automate_ mode permissions.
