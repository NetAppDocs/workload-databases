Discover existing database resources within workload factory for Databases to view configuration details from the inventory page and to explore savings.

== About this task
To discover existing database resources, you must add credentials to workload factory.

*The next step is adding credentials - https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html. This content is hosted in the setup admin guide. I'm not sure we have enough here to warrant a separate page for this task. What else could go here?*
