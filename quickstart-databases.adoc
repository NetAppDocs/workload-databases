You may have or need to create an AWS account. Add credentials if you don't have an AWS account. 

Databases has three different modes for users, each with their own requirements.

You'll have different requirements for permissions depending on the mode you choose to operate in. 

Databases has three different modes for users, each with their own requirements. 

* _Basic_ mode
+
In Basic mode, you can copy an empty template which you can complete outside of Workload Factory using the AWS CloudFormation console. Permissions aren't required.

* _Read_ mode
+
In read mode, you'll need some read-only permissions in AWS CloudFormation.
+
To use a ready-to-execute template that you fill out in Workload Factory for execution with AWS CloudFormation, you'll need AWS account credentials with some read-only permissions.  

* _Automate_ mode
+
In automate mode, you'll need AWS credentials, AWS CloudFormation permissions, and SSM connectivity.
+
To deploy and manage your workload resources within Workload Factory, you must have:
+
** AWS account credentials 
** AWS CloudFormation permissions 
** A deployed Amazon EC2 instance with an installed AWS Systems Manager Agent. The SSM Agent gives Workload Factory access to database host machines for installing, patching, or fetching data. 

And explain about existing or creating new credentials.
