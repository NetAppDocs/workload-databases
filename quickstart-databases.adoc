You can get started with Databases in Workload Factory in a few steps.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't have existing AWS credentials, you'll need to link:https://review.docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin_first-draft/manage-credentials.html[add credentials to an account manually^]. 
+
Verify that the credentials you use in Workload Factory have the correct permissions. The permissions you need depend on the mode you operate in. 
+
Databases has three different modes for users, each with their own requirements.

* _Basic_ mode
+
In Basic mode, you can copy an empty template which you can complete outside of Workload Factory using the AWS CloudFormation console. Permissions aren't required.

* _Read_ mode
+
In read mode, you'll need some read-only permissions in AWS CloudFormation.
+
To use a ready-to-execute template that you fill out in Workload Factory for execution with AWS CloudFormation, you'll need AWS account credentials with some read-only permissions.  

* _Automate_ mode
+
In automate mode, you'll need AWS credentials, AWS CloudFormation permissions, and SSM connectivity.
+
To deploy and manage your workload resources within Workload Factory, you must have:
+
** AWS account credentials 
** AWS CloudFormation permissions 
** A deployed Amazon EC2 instance with an installed AWS Systems Manager Agent. The SSM Agent gives Workload Factory access to database host machines for installing, patching, or fetching data.
