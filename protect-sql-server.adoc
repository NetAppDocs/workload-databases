Protect your Microsoft SQL Server applications data using BlueXP backup and recovery from the workload factory console. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account based on the policies you create. 

== About this task
Protecting your Microsoft SQL Server workloads involves implementing a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies provide multi-layer protection against both internal (insider) and external cybersecurity threats.
* Multiple media types ensure failover viability in the case of physical or logical failure of one media type.
* The onsite copy facilitates quick restores, with the offsite copies available just in case the onsite copy is compromised.

BlueXP backup and recovery leverages NetApp SnapMirror data replication technology to ensure that all the backups are fully synchronized by creating snapshot copies and transferring them to the backup locations.

== Before you begin
*What are the requirements?* 
The following are requirements to begin protecting Microsoft SQL Server workloads:

* A BlueXP Connector
+
Refer to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn how to configure a BlueXP Connector^] and link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[standard BlueXP requirements^].
+
The Ubuntu 22.04 LTS operating system is required for the Connector.

== Protect Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases
Protecting Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases involves resource discovery, prerequisites validation, and configuration and installation of the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server. The plug-in is a host-side component of NetApp Software that enables you to protect your Microsoft SQL Server workloads.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases inventory*.
. In Databases, select the *Inventory* tab. 
. Filter the *Engine type* to *Microsoft SQL Server*.
. Select *Protect* from the menu for the instance to protect.
. Select the *Connector* where you want the workload to be registered and protected.
. To prepare for data protection, Workload factory automatically registers your SQL Server resources in BlueXP backup and recovery, configures and installs the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server, and discovers resources to meet the prerequisites for protecting your SQL Server instance. Select *Start* to begin the process.
+
NOTE: After adding hosts to BlueXP backup and Recovery for protection, database discovery sometimes fails. To discover databases, you must set host resolution on the Connector. In the Ubuntu machine/On the hosted device, add the mapping of the IP address to the hostname in the `/etc/hosts` file.

. After the prerequisites are met, select *Redirect* to get redirected to the BlueXP backup and recovery console.

.What's next
From BlueXP backup and recovery, create a policy to protect your Microsoft SQL Server instance and databases.
