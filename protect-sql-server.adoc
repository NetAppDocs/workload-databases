Protect your Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or StorageGRID using BlueXP backup and recovery. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account based on the policies you create. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies provide multi-layer protection against both internal (insider) and external cybersecurity threats.
* Multiple media types ensure failover viability in the case of physical or logical failure of one media type.
* The onsite copy facilitates quick restores, with the offsite copies available just in case the onsite copy is compromised.

BlueXP backup and recovery leverages NetApp SnapMirror data replication technology to ensure that all the backups are fully synchronized by creating snapshot copies and transferring them to the backup locations.

To back up workloads, typically you create policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies^] for more information.


.Supported backup destinations

BlueXP backup and recovery enables you to back up Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from the following source working environments to the following secondary working environments and object storage in public and private cloud providers. Snapshot copies reside on the source working environment.

.Supported restore destinations

You can restore Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from a backup that resides in primary storage or a secondary working environment (a replicated volume) or in object storage (a backup file) to the following working environments. Snapshot copies reside on the source working environment and can be restored only to that same system.

== Protect Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases
Protecting 

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases inventory*.
. In Databases, select the *Inventory* tab. 
. Filter the *Engine type* to *Microsoft SQL Server*.
. Select *Protect* from the menu for the instance to protect.
. Select the *Connector* where you want the workload to be registered and protected.
. Workload factory automatically registers your SQL Server resources in BlueXP backup and recovery, configures and installs the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server, a host-side component of NetApp Software, on your SQL Server host, and discovers resources to meet the prerequisites for protecting your SQL Server instance.
. Select *Start*.

.Result
After the prerequisites are met, you're redirected to the BlueXP backup and recovery console where you can create a policy to protect your Microsoft SQL Server instance and databases.
