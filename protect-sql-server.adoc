Protect your Microsoft SQL Server applications data using BlueXP backup and recovery from the workload factory console. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account based on the policies you create. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies provide multi-layer protection against both internal (insider) and external cybersecurity threats.
* Multiple media types ensure failover viability in the case of physical or logical failure of one media type.
* The onsite copy facilitates quick restores, with the offsite copies available just in case the onsite copy is compromised.

BlueXP backup and recovery leverages NetApp SnapMirror data replication technology to ensure that all the backups are fully synchronized by creating snapshot copies and transferring them to the backup locations.

== Protect Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases
Protecting Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases involves resource discovery, prerequisites validation, and configuration and installation of the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server. The plug-in is a host-side component of NetApp Software that enables you to protect your Microsoft SQL Server workloads.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases inventory*.
. In Databases, select the *Inventory* tab. 
. Filter the *Engine type* to *Microsoft SQL Server*.
. Select *Protect* from the menu for the instance to protect.
. Select the *Connector* where you want the workload to be registered and protected.
. To prepare for data protection, Workload factory automatically registers your SQL Server resources in BlueXP backup and recovery, configures and installs the Plug-in for Microsoft SQL Server, and discovers resources to meet the prerequisites for protecting your SQL Server instance. Select *Start* to begin the process.
. After the prerequisites are met, you're redirected to the BlueXP backup and recovery console.

.What's next
From BlueXP backup and recovery, create a policy to protect your Microsoft SQL Server instance and databases.
