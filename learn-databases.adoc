== Workload Factory benefits for self-managed databases
Workload Factory offers the following beneficial best practices and automation for self-managed databases.

=== Best practices

* Integrated knowledge from AWS Cloud, Microsoft Windows and SQL servers, and NetApp ONTAP for SQL server deployments on EC2 instances.
* Total cost of ownership optimized deployment.  
* End-to-end deployment automation that follows AWS, Microsoft and ONTAP best practices. 
* _Quick create_ deployment mode helps you avoid potential pitfalls with manual configuration. 

=== Automation with Workload Factory Codebox
Workload Factory introduces built-in automation with the _Codebox_. The Codebox offers the following automation benefits: 

* *Code snippet generation*: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) snippets are generated during resource creation, allowing seamless integration with existing orchestration workflows.
* *Infrastructure-as-code co-pilot*: the Codebox is an Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) co-pilot that helps developers and DevOps generate code to execute any operation supported by Workload Factory.
* *Code viewer and automation catalog*: the Codebox provides a code viewer for quick analysis of automation and an automation catalog for quick future re-use.

=== Workload Factory for Databases features
Workload Factory for Databases offers the following features:

* *Simple, fast deployments*: simplify and streamline your provisioning experience by selecting answers to specification questions and eliminating the time typically required to investigate how to provision and configure your Microsoft SQL Server on AWS.
* *Automated orchestration*: available via the Workload Factory console with _Quick_ and _Advanced_ create deployment modes, the Chatbot, and AWS CloudFormation via the Codebox.
* *Built-in features*: utilize NetApp, Microsoft, and Amazon best practices and AWS resource selections built in to deployment configuration.
* *Cost estimation*: assess potential cost savings with the Savings calculator that estimates and details storage, compute, SQL licensing, snapshot, and clone itemized costs for existing Microsoft SQL Server deployments with Elastic Block Store and FSx for Windows File Server compared with FSx for ONTAP.
* *Reusable automation templates*: create, re-use, and customize CloudFormation templates from the Workload Factory Codebox for future Microsoft SQL Server deployments in multiple environments.
* *AWS resource discovery and provisioning*: automatically detect Microsoft SQL Servers on FSx for ONTAP, FSx for Windows File Servers, and Elastic Block Store deployed from your AWS account. The Databases Inventory serves as a launching point for exploring costs savings opportunities for servers in other AWS storage systems or a management tool for FSx for ONTAP based servers and instances.
* *Sandbox creation*: create an on-demand, isolated database environment that can be used for testing, integration, diagnostics, and training, without affecting production data. 
* *Database creation*: create a user database for your existing Microsoft SQL Servers with _Quick_ or _Advanced_ create modes to configure your database collation, file names, and sizes. Storage configuration is included. 
* *Job Monitoring*: monitor and track database job execution progress and diagnose and troubleshoot issues in case any failure occurs.
* *Continuous optimization*: continuously scans your Microsoft SQL Server estate offline, providing you with a comprehensive report of insights, opportunities, and recommendations to help you achieve operational excellence.
