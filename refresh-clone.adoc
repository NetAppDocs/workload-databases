Refresh a database (sandbox) clone in NetApp Workload Factory for Databases so that it is equivalent to the source database at the current moment or a previous point in time. 

.About this task
Refreshing a clone updates the clone either to the source database at the current moment or to a snapshot of the source database taken at a previous point in time. Any changes made to the sandbox clone will be deleted. 

.Before you begin
A refresh is only possible when the source database is active. 

To refresh a database clone from a snapshot, the source database must have at least one snapshot for the operation.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. Select the menu image:workloads-menu-icon.png[The hamburger menu icon is used to navigate to workloads like storage, eda, ai, databases, vmware, and administration.] and then select *Databases*. 
. From the Databases menu, select *Sandboxes*.
. In Sandboxes, select the action menu of the sandbox clone you want to refresh.
. Select *Refresh*. 
. In the Refresh dialog, select one of the following options: 
.. *Refresh to current time*
.. *Refresh to point in time* 
+
For this option, select the database snapshot from the dropdown menu to refresh to. 
. Click *Refresh*.
