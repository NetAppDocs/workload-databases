Detect a Microsoft SQL Server instance in BlueXP workload factory for Databases. 

This task is for detecting an _undetected instance_.

.About this task
When AWS credentials are associated in workload factory, Databases allows automated discovery of Microsoft SQL Servers beginning with SQL server 2016 with the following AWS storage types: 

* FSx for ONTAP
* Elastic Block Store (EBS)
* FSx for Windows File Server

In Databases, discovered instances are categorized as follows: 

* _Undetected instances_: undetected instances that have been automatically discovered by workload factory. Instances are undetected in the following cases: 
** Microsoft SQL Server authentication fails.
** The FSx for ONTAP file system for the Microsoft SQL Server isn't registered with your account in workload factory.  
* _Unmanaged instances_: detected instances that are not managed by workload factory
* _Managed instances_: detected instances that are managed by workload factory

The first step to managing a Microsoft SQL Server instance, or host instance, in workload factory for Databases is detecting an undetected database server instance.  

.Before you begin
The requirements for detecting an undetected database server instance are as follows: 

* You must have link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[AWS account credentials^] to detect a database server instance in workload factory. 
* The storage type for the instance must be one of the following: 
** FSx for ONTAP
** Elastic Block Store (EBS) 
** FSx for Windows File Server
* EC2 instances must have a role/instance profile that allows SSM connection for detection to work. 
+
When a Microsoft SQL instance is detected, the existing environment isn't modified. Detection happens through AWS Systems Manager Session Manager (SSM). Without the right IAM instance profile, detection will fail. link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-troubleshooting.html[Learn more about SSM troubleshooting^].

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases Inventory*.
. In Databases, select the *Inventory* tab. 
. Click the dropdown arrow to expand the row of the host to detect.
+
The host expands and host instances appear.  
. Click the three dots menu of the instance to detect.
. Click *Detect*.
. In the *Detect instance* dialog, provide the Microsoft SQL Server user name and password or FSx for ONTAP user name and password. 
+
Workload factory validates your Microsoft SQL credentials or FSx for ONTAP credentials. 
+
If either of these credentials isn't available, workload factory tries to install the `aws.tools.SimpleSystemsManagement` module in PowerShell.
. Click *Detect*.
+
Detected instance information appears. 
. Select *Yes, Manage instance via Workload Factory* or *No*. 
. Click *Done*. 

.What's next
When the storage type for the host instance is FSx for ONTAP, you can link:manage-server.html[manage the instance via workload factory].
