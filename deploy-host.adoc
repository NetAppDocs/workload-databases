Create a Microsoft SQL server in Workload Factory Databases. 

== About this task
You can create a new Microsoft SQL server, or database host, in Workload Factory Databases. Learn more about the following parameters and the <<Before you begin,requirements>> to complete this operation.

=== FSx for ONTAP file system deployments
Creating a new Microsoft SQL server requires an FSx for ONTAP file system as the storage backend. You can use an existing FSx for ONTAP file system or create a new file system. If you select an existing FSx for ONTAP file system as your database server storage backend, we create a new storage VM for the Microsoft SQL workloads. 

FSx for ONTAP file systems have two Microsoft SQL deployment models: _Failover Cluster Instance (FCI)_ or _Standalone_. Different resources are created for the FSx for ONTAP file system depending on the FSx for ONTAP deployment model you select.

NOTE: In _Quick create_, FCI is the default deployment model.

.Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) Microsoft SQL deployment
A multiple Availability Zone FSx for NetApp ONTAP filesystem is deployed when a new FSx for ONTAP file system is selected for FCI deployment. 

Separate volumes and LUNs are created for data, log, and tempdb files for an FCI deployment. An additional volume and LUN is created for Quorum or witness disk for Windows cluster. 

.Standalone Microsoft SQL deployment
A single Availability Zone FSx for ONTAP filesystem is created when a new Microsoft SQL server is created. In addition, separate volumes and LUNs are created for data, log, and tempdb files

=== Active Directory
The following occurs for Active Directory during deployment: 

* A new Microsoft SQL service account is created in the domain if you don't provide an existing SQL service account.
* The Windows cluster, node host names, and Microsoft SQL FCI name are added as managed computers to the Microsoft SQL service account. 
* The Windows cluster entry is assigned permissions to add computers to the domain. 

NOTE: If you decide to rollback your resources, these entries are not removed automatically and can be cleaned up from the DNS server. For more information, refer to (add link to rollback information).

== Before you begin
You must have link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/manage-credentials.html[AWS credentials^] and permissions to deploy a new database host in Workload Factory. 

Alternatively, you can use the Codebox to copy an empty template or create a completed template so that you can deploy a database outside of Workload Factory using REST API, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation. 

link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/codebox-automation.html[Learn more about Codebox automation^].

When connecting to Active Directory, you must have administrative access with permissions to do the following: 

* Join the domain  
* Create Computer Objects 
* Create objects in default Organization Unit (OU) 
* Read all properties 
* Make this domain user as a local admin on the AD nodes 
* Create SQL Server service user in the AD, if it doesn't exist already 

.Steps
. Log in to the NetApp Workload Factory.
. In the Databases tile, click *Deploy database*. 

You can use _Quick create_ or _Advanced create_ deployment modes to complete this task in Workload Factory.

If desired, you can use the Codebox to create a template so that you can deploy a database outside of Workload Factory using REST API, AWS CLI, or AWS CloudFormation. In _Basic_ mode, you'll copy the empty template from the Codebox. In _Read_ mode, you can complete the _Quick create_ or _Advanced create_ form and then copy it.

+
Ensure security groups for an existing interface endpoint allow access to HTTPS (443) protocol to the selected subnets.

... In the *Password* field, enter a password for the Active Directory domain.
. Under *Infrastructure settings*, provide the following:  
.. *FSx for ONTAP system*: You can create a new FSx for ONTAP file system or use an existing FSx for ONTAP file system. 
... *Create new FSx for ONTAP*


.. *Data drive size*: Enter the data drive capacity and select the capacity unit.

+ 
Alternatively, if you want to change any of these default settings now, create the file system with Advanced create. 
.. *Estimated cost*: Provides an estimate of charges that you might incur if you deployed the resources shown.

AWS Service interface endpoints (SQS, FSx, EC2, CloudWatch, Cloud Formation, SSM) and S3 gateway endpoint are created during deployment if not found.  
+
VPC DNS attributes (`EnableDnsSupport`` and `EnableDnsHostnames``) are modified to enable resolve endpoint address resolution if not set to true already. 

.. *Availability zones*: Select availability zones and subnets according to the deployment model you selected.
+
NOTE: FCI deployments are only supported on Multiple Availability Zone (MAZ) FSx for ONTAP configurations. 
+ 
NOTE: Subnets should not share the same route table for high availability. 
+
For standalone deployments::: 
... In the *Cluster configuration - Node 1* field, select an availability zone from the *Availability zone* from the dropdown menu and a subnet from the *Subnet* dropdown menu. 
+
For FCI deployments::: 
... In the *Cluster configuration - Node 1* field, select the primary availability zone for the MAZ FSx for ONTAP configuration from the *Availability zone* dropdown menu and a subnet from the primary availability zone from the *Subnet* dropdown menu. 
... In the *Cluster configuration - Node 2* field, select the secondary availability zone for the MAZ FSx for ONTAP configuration from the *Availability zone* dropdown menu and a subnet from the secondary availability zone from the *Subnet* dropdown menu. 

.. *Security group*: â€“ Look in the stage environment
+
As part of deployment three security groups get attached to the SQL nodes (EC2 instances). 
+
1. A workload security group is created to allow ports and protocols required for the SQL and Windows cluster communication on nodes. 
+
2. In case of AWS managed Active Directory, the SG attached to the directory service will be automatically added to the SQL nodes, to allow communication with the AD.  
+
3. In case of existing FSx for ONTAP file system, the security group associated with it is added automatically to the SQL nodes which allows communication to the file system. When a new FSx for ONTAP system is created, a new security group is created for the FSx file system and the same security group also gets attached to SQL nodes.
+
You can select an additional security groups that allows traffic from your existing host farm/Windows clients. These additional security groups are when selecting user-managed Active Directory. The security group should allow communication to this domain from the subnets where EC2 instances for SQL are configured.
