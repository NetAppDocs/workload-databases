[.lead]
Using configuration analysis insights and recommendations, leverage workload factory to implement best practices for your database configurations. You can easily review the well-architected status, learn about issues with database configurations, and take action to improve any configurations that aren't optimized for reliability, security, efficiency, performance, and cost.

.About this task
Workload factory analyzes database configurations daily. The daily analysis provides the well-architected status, and insights and recommendations with options to automatically fix configuration issues so that your configurations meet best practices. 

You have options to review the recommendations for configuration issues and fix those issues from the Databases inventory within the workload factory console. 

What is analyzed::
Workload factory analyzes the well-architected status of the following configurations for Microsoft SQL Server instances:  

* Storage sizing: includes storage tier, file system headroom, log drive size, and TempDB drive size  
* Storage layout: includes user data files placement, log files placement, and TempDB placement
* Storage configuration: includes capacity management, thin provisioning, tiering policy, snapshots, Microsoft Multipath I/O (MPIO) status, and MPIO timeout setting
* Compute: includes rightsizing, operating system patches, and network adapter settings like Receive Side Scaling (RSS) and TCP offloading
* Applications: includes Microsoft SQL Server licenses, Microsoft SQL Server patch, and MAXDOP settings 
* Resiliency: includes local snapshots, FSx for ONTAP backups, and cross-region replication (CRR)
* Clones: includes options to refresh and delete clones (sandboxes) that were created in or outside of workload factory and are older than 60 days

.Before you begin
* You must have link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[AWS account credentials and read/write permissions^] to analyze your database configurations. 
* To assess the storage of a Microsoft SQL Server instance, the instance must be registered in workload factory and the storage type must be FSx for ONTAP. link:register-instance.html[Learn how to register an instance.]
* Make sure you review each recommendation carefully before selecting to fix a setting or configuration. For RSS and MAXDOP settings, we suggest that you test the recommended settings to determine performance improvements before making changes to your production environment. 

NOTE: The remediation process may cause instance downtimes or service interruptions. Make sure you review the recommendation carefully before you choose to fix a configuration.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases inventory*.
. In the *Inventory* tab, select the *Instances* tab.
. Select *Fix issues* to view configuration issues for the instance. 
. On the Well-architected status page for the instance, review the findings from the analysis. 
+
You can filter configuration issues by categories, subcategories, status, severity, and tags. 
+ 
You can also download a report of the findings by selecting *Export PDF*.  
. Select the dropdown arrow to view the recommendation for any configuration. Recommendations include best practices, potential pitfalls of unoptimized configurations, and important considerations. Make sure you review the recommendation carefully. 
. Select to *View and fix* configuration issues when the option is available.
+
*Select all* is the default, but you can select specific resources to fix.
+
.. For all configurations except clone cleanup, review the recommendation details to learn what will happen if you choose to fix the issue. Some remediation operations may cause instance downtimes or service interruptions. 
.. For clone cleanup, select cloned databases (sandboxes) to refresh or delete.
+
* Refreshing a clone synchronizes it with its source database. Refresh is available only for clones created in workload factory.
* Deleting a clone removes it permanently, frees up storage space, and reduces costs. You can delete clones created in and outside of workload factory.

. Select *Continue* to fix the configuration issue. 

.Result
Workload factory begins fixing the issue(s). Select the *Job monitoring* tab to view the status of the operation.
