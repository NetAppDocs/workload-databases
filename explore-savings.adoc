Explore savings for your database workloads by comparing the costs of using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and FSx for Windows File Server storage with FSx for ONTAP storage. 

Workload Factory provides a savings calculator so you can compare various cost components of running Microsoft SQL Server workloads like storage, compute, SQL license, snapshots, and clones for your database workloads on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS) and FSx for Windows File Server storage. Depending on your storage requirements, you might find that FSx for ONTAP file systems are the most cost effective for your database workloads.
The calculator displays whether the storage for the database workloads on these Microsoft SQL Servers would cost less if you used an FSx for ONTAP file system.

Cost savings in dollar amount and percentage savings as well as the total monthly cost for using Microsoft SQL Server on FSx for ONTAP and Elastic Block Store storage display on the left."]

If Workload Factory determines that you could save money by running these workloads on an FSx for ONTAP file system, you can deploy Microsoft SQL over FSx for ONTAP directly from the calculator in Workload Factory. When you have multiple Microsoft SQL Server instances over Elastic Block Store or FSx for Windows File Server storage, we'll recommend an FSx for ONTAP configuration with a single SQL instance.

//In some cases, Workload Factory may recommend that you deploy multiple file systems based on the amount of storage you are currently using, and based on the performance characteristics of your database workloads. 

== Calculator options
Two calculator options are available for making the cost comparison between your systems and FSx for ONTAP — customization and detection.

Explore savings via customization: You provide the configuration settings for Microsoft SQL server on Amazon EC2 with EBS or FSx for Windows File Server including the region, deployment model, SQL server edition, monthly data change rate, snapshot frequency, and more.

Explore savings for detected hosts: Workload Factory links to your existing Microsoft SQL servers and pulls in the details to the calculator for automatic comparison. You'll need to grant automate permissions to use this calculator option. You can change the use case, but all other details are automatically determined in the calculation.

== Explore savings for detected hosts
Workload Factory enters the detected Elastic Block Store and FSx for Windows File Server host characteristics so that you can explore savings automatically.

.Before you begin
Complete the following prerequisites before you begin: 

* Make sure you link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[grant _automate_ permissions^] in your AWS account to detect Elastic Block Store (EBS) and FSx for Windows systems in your Databases inventory. 
* Detect hosts in EBS and FSx for Windows storage in your Databases inventory. link:detect-host.html[Learn how to detect hosts].

//Unsure if this is true for Databases - NOTE: Automatic mode doesn’t support calculations for EBS snapshots and FSx for Windows File Server shadow copies. In manual mode, you can provide EBS and FSx for Windows File Server snapshot details.   

Follow the steps under the tab for your storage type.
