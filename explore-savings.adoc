Explore savings for your database workloads by comparing the costs of using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage with FSx for ONTAP storage. 

Workload Factory provides a savings calculator so you can compare various cost components of running Microsoft SQL Server workloads like storage, compute, SQL license, snapshots, and clones for your database workloads on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS) storage. Depending on your storage requirements, you might find that FSx for ONTAP file systems are the most cost effective for your database workloads.
//Add  and FSx for Windows File Server when available.

The calculator displays whether the storage for the database workloads on these Microsoft SQL Servers would cost less if you used an FSx for ONTAP file system.

Cost savings in dollar amount and percentage savings as well as the total monthly cost for using Microsoft SQL Server on FSx for ONTAP and Elastic Block Store storage display on the left."]

If Workload Factory determines that you could save money by running these workloads on an FSx for ONTAP file system, you can deploy Microsoft SQL over FSx for ONTAP directly from the calculator in Workload Factory. When you have multiple Microsoft SQL Server instances over Elastic Block Store storage, we'll recommend a FSx for ONTAP configuration with a single SQL instance.

//In some cases, Workload Factory may recommend that you deploy multiple file systems based on the amount of storage you are currently using, and based on the performance characteristics of your database workloads. 

== Provide your system requirements
If you have enabled _automate_ mode (link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/operational-modes.html[learn more about modes]) by adding AWS credentials to your Workload Factory account, then Workload Factory can identify all the storage systems running Microsoft SQL Server that are available in your AWS account. The AWS account that is searched is based on the credentials you've defined in your Workload Factory account.  
//add _read_ mode above when it is supported

This figure shows Microsoft SQL Server hosts on EBS storage in the Explore savings tab that have been discovered in an AWS account.

//Add when manual mode is available in basic mode.
//If you haven't added credentials to link your Workload Factory account with an AWS account (called _basic_ mode), 

You can explore savings automatically for a selected host or manually enter settings for a Microsoft SQL Server configuration you are planning to deploy. The savings calculator will determine the best file system based on cost.

.Before you begin
Complete the following prerequisites before you begin: 

* Make sure you link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[grant _automate_ permissions^] in your AWS account to detect Elastic Block Store (EBS) systems in your Databases inventory. 
* Detect hosts in EBS storage in your Databases inventory. link:detect-host.html[Learn how to detect hosts].

== Explore savings
You can explore savings of a selected host or use the manual method.

.Explore savings of selected host
--
Workload Factory enters the selected host characteristics so that you can explore savings automatically. 

.Steps
. Log in to the link:https://console.workloads.netapp.com[Workload Factory console^]. 
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases inventory*. 
. Select the *Explore savings* tab.
. Click *Explore savings* for the database server using EBS storage.
. Optionally, provide the following details on clone and snapshots in your EBS storage for a more accurate cost savings estimate. 
.. *Snapshot frequency*: Select a snapshot frequency from the dropdown menu. 
.. *Clone refresh frequency*: Select a clone refresh frequency from the dropdown menu. 
.. *Monthly change rate*: Enter the percentage that clone and snapshot data changes on average per month.  
. Review the calculations and recommendation provided on the page.

.Explore savings manually
--
You can customize settings for Microsoft SQL Server, Amazon EC2, and Elastic Block Store settings to explore savings manually. 

.Steps
. Log in to the link:https://console.workloads.netapp.com[Workload Factory console^]. 
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases inventory*. 
. Select the *Explore savings* tab.
. Under Manual explore savings, click *Explore savings manually*.

.. *Region*: Select a region from the dropdown menu. 
.. *Deployment model*: Select a deployment model from the dropdown menu.
.. *SQL Server edition*: Select the SQL Server edition from the dropdown menu.
.. *Monthly data change rate (%)*: Enter the percentage that clone and snapshot data changes on average per month.  
.. *Snapshot frequency*: Select a snapshot frequency from the dropdown menu. 
.. *Clone refresh frequency*: Select a clone refresh frequency from the dropdown menu. 
.. *Monthly SQL BYOL cost ($)*: Optionally, enter the monthly SQL BYOL cost in dollars.  
.. Under EC2 specifications, provide the following: 
+
* *Machine description*: Optionally, enter a name to describe the machine.
* *Instance type*: Select the EC2 instance type from the dropdown menu. 
.. Under Volume types, provide the following details for at least one volume type. IOPS and throughput apply to certain disk type volumes.

== Deploy FSx for ONTAP file systems
If you'd like to switch to FSx for ONTAP to realize cost savings, click *Create* to create the file system(s) directly from the Create an FSx for ONTAP file system wizard or click *Save* to save the recommended configuration(s) for later. 

Workload Factory doesn't support saving or creating multiple FSx for ONTAP file systems. 

Deployment methods:::
In _automate_ mode, you can deploy the FSx for ONTAP file system directly from Workload Factory. You can also copy the content from the Codebox window and deploy the system using one of the Codebox methods.

In  _basic_ mode, you can copy the content from the Codebox window and deploy the FSx for ONTAP file system using one of the Codebox methods.
