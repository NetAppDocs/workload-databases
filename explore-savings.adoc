= Explore savings in BlueXP workload factory for Databases

[.lead]
Explore savings in BlueXP workload factory for Databases for your database workloads by comparing the costs of using Microsoft SQL Server on Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), FSx for Windows File Server, and on-premises storage with FSx for ONTAP storage. 

== About this task
Workload factory has several ways for you to explore savings for your database workloads running on Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS), FSx for Windows File Server, and on-premises storage - from the Dashboard, from the Inventory tab, and from the Explore savings tab. In all cases, you can use the savings calculator to compare various cost components of running Microsoft SQL Server workloads like storage, compute, SQL license, snapshots, and clones for your database workloads on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS), FSx for Windows File Server, and on-premises storage.

If workload factory determines that you could save money by running these workloads on an FSx for ONTAP file system, you can deploy Microsoft SQL over FSx for ONTAP directly from the savings calculator in workload factory. When you have multiple Microsoft SQL Server instances over Elastic Block Store, FSx for Windows File Server, or on-premises storage, we'll recommend an FSx for ONTAP configuration with a single SQL instance.

.Potential savings for all database workloads
Go to the Databases *Dashboard* from the workload factory console to get an overview of potential cost savings for running all of your database workloads on FSx for ONTAP. In the *Potential savings* tile, you can view the number of all database workloads you have on Elastic Block Store and FSx for Windows File Server, the potential cost savings, the savings percentage, and visual representation in the bar graph.

The potential savings tile shows the number of all database workloads you have on Elastic Block Store and FSx for Windows File Server, the potential cost savings, the savings percentage, and visual representation in the bar graph."]

.Savings calculator
You can utilize the savings calculator so you can compare various cost components of running Microsoft SQL Server workloads like storage, compute, SQL license, snapshots, and clones for your database workloads on FSx for ONTAP file systems against Elastic Block Store (EBS), FSx for Windows File Server, and on-premises storage. Depending on your storage requirements, you might find that FSx for ONTAP file systems are the most cost effective for your database workloads.

The calculator displays whether the storage for the database workloads on these Microsoft SQL Servers would cost less if you used an FSx for ONTAP file system. <<Calculator options,Learn how to use the calculator.>>

Cost savings in dollar amount and percentage savings as well as the total monthly cost for using Microsoft SQL Server on FSx for ONTAP and Elastic Block Store storage display on the left."]

//In some cases, workload factory may recommend that you deploy multiple file systems based on the amount of storage you are currently using, and based on the performance characteristics of your database workloads. 

== SQL Server deployment analysis
The calculator performs a comprehensive analysis of your SQL Server deployment to ensure that the resources and features being utilized are appropriately matched to the SQL Server edition. Here are the key factors and conditions the calculator checks before recommending a downgrade to Standard Edition:

Deployment model:: 
The calculator evaluates the deployment model and whether Enterprise edition is required.

Allocated resources:: 
The calculator assesses the conditions of the following license-dependent allocated resources:
+
* Target Instance vCPUs: The instance has 48 or fewer virtual CPUs.
* Memory Allocation: The instance has 128GB or less of memory.

Enterprise feature usage:: 
The calculator verifies if any of the following Enterprise features are in use:
+
* Database-level Enterprise features
* Online index operations
* Resource Governor
* Peer-to-peer or Oracle replication
* R/Python extensions
* Memory-optimized TempDB

If the assessed SQL Server instance doesn't utilize any of the above Enterprise features and meets the resource constraints, the calculator will recommend downgrading the license to Standard Edition. This recommendation is made to help you optimize your SQL Server licensing costs without compromising performance or functionality.

== Calculator options
Two calculator options are available for making the cost comparison between your systems and FSx for ONTAP — customization and detection.

Explore savings via customization: You provide the configuration settings for Microsoft SQL server on Amazon EC2 with EBS or FSx for Windows File Server including the region, deployment model, SQL server edition, monthly data change rate, snapshot frequency, and more.

Explore savings for detected hosts: Workload factory links to your existing Microsoft SQL servers and pulls in the details to the calculator for automatic comparison. You'll need to grant _read-only_ or _read/write_ permissions to use this calculator option. You can change the use case, but all other details are automatically determined in the calculation.

Additionally, you can link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/add-credentials.html[add AWS credentials^] to improve the accuracy of the calculator analysis. Select *Calculate savings based on existing resources*. You'll be redirected to the Add credentials page. After you add credentials, select the existing resources to compare with FSx for ONTAP, and select *Explore savings*.

On-premises host removal::: After you've explored savings for a Microsoft SQL server on-premises host, you have the option to remove the on-premises host record from BlueXP workload factory. Select the three-dot menu of the Microsoft SQL Server on-premises host and then select *Delete*. 

== Deploy Microsoft SQL Server on AWS EC2 using FSx for ONTAP
If you'd like to switch to FSx for ONTAP to realize cost savings, click *Create* to create the recommended configuration(s) directly from the Create new Microsoft SQL server wizard or click *Save* to save the recommended configuration(s) for later. 

NOTE: Workload factory doesn't support saving or creating multiple FSx for ONTAP file systems. 

Deployment methods:::
In _automate_ mode, you can deploy the new Microsoft SQL server on AWS EC2 using FSx for ONTAP directly from workload factory. You can also copy the content from the Codebox window and deploy the recommended configuration using one of the Codebox methods.
