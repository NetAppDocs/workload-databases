=== Well-architected analysis includes high-availability cluster validation

The well-architected analysis now includes validation for high-availability clusters. This validation checks all cluster-related configurations from the server side, including disk availability and configuration on both nodes, Windows cluster configuration, and failover readiness. This ensures that the Windows cluster is properly set up and can successfully failover when needed.
