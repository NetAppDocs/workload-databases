=== Well-architected analysis includes high-availability cluster validation

The well-architected analysis now includes validation for high-availability clusters. This validation checks all cluster-related configurations from the server side, including disk availability and configuration on both nodes, Windows cluster configuration, and failover readiness. This ensures that the Windows cluster is properly set up and can successfully failover when needed.

=== Multi-level menu available for instances  
The workload factory console now includes a multi-level menu for instances. This change enhances the user experience by providing a more organized and intuitive navigation structure for managing instances. Menu options for instance management includes viewing the instance dashboard, viewing databases, creating a database, and creating a sandbox clone.

=== Discover database resources in workload factory

Now you can now discover existing database resources from the Learn more page in the workload factory console. After discovery, your resources are available in the inventory page, which provides insights into your current database resources and helps you identify opportunities for optimization and improvement. To discover resources, you must have _read-only_ or _read/write_ permissions for the workload factory console.
