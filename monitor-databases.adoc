[.lead]
Track database jobs and monitor databases within NetApp Workload Factory for Databases for improved visibility and control over database operations.

== About this task 
Databases provides job monitoring so you can track job progress, and diagnose and troubleshoot in case any failure occurs. You can filter jobs by type and status, find jobs using the search function, and download the jobs table.

Job monitoring supports up to three levels of monitoring depending on the job. For example, for new database and sandbox clone creation, job monitoring tracks parent jobs and sub-jobs.  

.Job monitoring levels

* Level 1 (parent job): Tracks the host deployment job.
* Level 2 (sub-job): Tracks the sub-jobs related to the host deployment parent job. 
* Level 3 (task): Lists the sequence of actions taken on each resource.

.Job status
The job monitoring feature tracks _in progress_, _completed_, _completed with issues_, and _failed_ jobs daily, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly.

.Job events retention
Job monitoring events are retained in the user interface for 30 days. 

== Monitor jobs
