Deregister a host instance if you no longer want to deploy or monitor instance resources. Deregistering instances also removes the amount of storage capacity used by the host instance. 

You can re-register the instance later.

.Steps
. Log in using one of the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/workload-setup-admin/console-experiences.html[console experiences^].
. In the Databases tile, select *Go to Databases inventory*.
. In Databases, select the *Inventory* tab. 
. Click the dropdown arrow to expand the row of the host instance to deregister. 
+
The host expands and the host instances appear. 
. Click the three-dot menu of the instance to deregister. 
. Select *Deregister*. 

.Result
The host instance is now deregistered. You can register the instance again later.
