Deregister a resource, such as a Microsoft SQL Server instance or an Oracle database, if you no longer want to deploy or monitor resources from the NetApp Workload Factory console. Deregistering resources also removes the amount of FSx for ONTAP storage capacity used by the instance. 

You can register the resource again.
